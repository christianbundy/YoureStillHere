You're Still Here
=================

Time-consuming websites suck. After using StayFocused, Leechblock, and Nanny â€“ I originally wrote this Chrome extension to just remind me every once in a while that I was *still* on a time-consuming website with a simple **"You're still here"**.

Instead of trying to outsmart yourself with programs and network configs, work on excercising your self-discipline with a little extra nudge.

This extension uses a [fork](https://github.com/ChristianBundy/jquery-notification) of code originally written by [Claviska](https://github.com/claviska) from 2011 dual licensed under the MIT / GPLv2 licenses.
