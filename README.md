You're Still Here
=================

Time-consuming websites suck. This Chrome extension will remind you every once in a while that you're *still* on a time-consuming website with a quick and simple dialog reminding you that **"You're still here"**.

Instead of trying to outsmart yourself with programs and network configs, excercise your self-discipline with a little extra nudge.

This extension uses a [fork](https://github.com/ChristianBundy/jquery-notification) of code originally written by [Claviska](https://github.com/claviska) from 2011 dual licensed under the MIT / GPLv2 licenses.
